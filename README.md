## Disclaimer
We do not know if this mask will protect you from either inhaling a contagious virus, or releasing one into the air yourself, upon exhaling, coughing or sneezing.

### Part I:The Mask Parts
To begin, download two files, the mask, and the filter holder. Print them both on a 3D printer. If you don’t have a 3D printer, or have thought about buying one, now is a great time.  We’d recommend [this one](https://shop.prusa3d.com/en/3d-printers/181-original-prusa-i3-mk3-3d-printer.html#) or [this one](https://shop.prusa3d.com/en/3d-printers/994-original-prusa-mini.html#).  

For printing, PLA material is fine with 10% infill. If the mask is sliced with the front square (“air in”) side down, no supports will be needed.  Combine the filter holder and mask in the same print job (arrange them on the build plate in the slicer software). It’ll take about 7 hours to complete. The default size is large. Scale down (in your slicer) to 90% for medium and 80% for small. Here’s what you’ll get.

### Part II: Fitting the mask
Immerse the face side of the mask in boiling water for 30 seconds or so, as shown here.

</p>

Push the mask firmly against your face, and pinch it (lightly), mostly on the nose and cheek covers, so it loosely fits the contours of your face. Do not pinch it tightly at this point, as this is not the final fitting. Just adapt it somewhat to your face. The final seal is coming (below).

### Part III: Seal
Get some 5/16” D-shape weatherseal tape (Home Depot link). Here’s some. You can see the “D” shape. The yellow strip is peeled away, exposing an adhesive layer.

Work one continuous piece of the tape into the inner perimeter of the mask, like this.

When done carefully match the two ends.

### Part IV: Final Fitting
Again place the mask in boiling water for 30 seconds or so, and push it firmly against your face.  Pinch all sides inward toward your nose and cheeks, so the mask is tight and snug, and also comfortable.  The adhesive on the weatherstrip will hold up in the hot water, but you might have to press the weatherstrip against the mask again, to firm it up again.

Optional: When done, you can add a line of [silicon sealant](https://www.homedepot.com/p/DAP-Silicone-Max-2-8-oz-Clear-100-Premium-Kitchen-and-Bath-Silicone-Sealant-08794/301531803)in the small gap between the weatherseal and plastic.

A standard test is to push the mask against your face, sealing the filter hole with your hand, then exhaling strongly, and noting any outward leaks under the seal.

### Part V: Attachments
Next, decide how you want to attach the mask to your face.  You can tie elastic to the holes, like this:

We found the masks hard to adjust this way, so we made a T-shaped add-on that allows one to use button-hole elastic. Here’s the adapter (design file [here](https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:4283952)):

It goes into the mask like this:
