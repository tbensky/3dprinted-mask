## Disclaimer
A homemade mask covering your face and nose can possibly do two things: 

1. Protect other people from you. Should you sneeze or cough, something covering your mouth and nose will act to stop your expelled droplets from becoming airborne and possibly infecting someone else.  

2. Harder to achieve is a mask that will prevent you from inhaling something contagious and airborne that you may encounter.

We do not know if this mask does either. It is merely a workflow consisting of various resources we pulled from around the web. The evnetual mask seal feels good, to the point that your breathing action will be noticeably modified when wearing the mask. It will be clear that your inhaling and exhaling will mostly be forced through the filter material. What precise action the filter accomplishes (1 or 2 above), we don't know. 

### Part I:The Mask Parts
To begin, download two files, the mask, and the filter holder. Print them both on a 3D printer. If you don’t have a 3D printer, or have thought about buying one, now is a great time.  We’d recommend [this one](https://shop.prusa3d.com/en/3d-printers/181-original-prusa-i3-mk3-3d-printer.html#) or [this one](https://shop.prusa3d.com/en/3d-printers/994-original-prusa-mini.html#).  

For printing, PLA material is fine with 10% infill. If the mask is sliced with the front square (“air in”) side down, no supports will be needed.  Combine the filter holder and mask in the same print job (arrange them on the build plate in the slicer software). It’ll take about 7 hours to complete. The default size is large. Scale down (in your slicer) to 90% for medium and 80% for small. Here’s what you’ll get.

</p>

### Part II: Fitting the mask
Immerse the face side of the mask in boiling water for 30 seconds or so, as shown here.

<p align="center">
   <img src=https://github.com/tbensky/3dprinted-mask/blob/master/mask_water.JPG>
</p>

Push the mask firmly against your face, and pinch it (lightly), mostly on the nose and cheek covers, so it loosely fits the contours of your face. Do not pinch it tightly at this point, as this is not the final fitting. Just adapt it somewhat to your face. The final seal is coming (below).

### Part III: Seal
Get some 5/16” D-shape weatherseal tape (Home Depot link). Here’s some. You can see the “D” shape. The yellow strip is peeled away, exposing an adhesive layer.

<p align="center">

</p>


Work one continuous piece of the tape into the inner perimeter of the mask, like this.

<p align="center">
   <img src="https://github.com/tbensky/3dprinted-mask/blob/master/D-shape_start copy.JPG">
</p>

When done carefully match the two ends.

</p>

### Part IV: Final Fitting
Again place the mask in boiling water for 30 seconds or so, and push it firmly against your face.  Pinch all sides inward toward your nose and cheeks, so the mask is tight and snug, and also comfortable.  The adhesive on the weatherstrip will hold up in the hot water, but you might have to press the weatherstrip against the mask again, to firm it up again.

Optional: When done, you can add a line of [silicon sealant](https://www.homedepot.com/p/DAP-Silicone-Max-2-8-oz-Clear-100-Premium-Kitchen-and-Bath-Silicone-Sealant-08794/301531803)in the small gap between the weatherseal and plastic.

A standard test is to push the mask against your face, sealing the filter hole with your hand, then exhaling strongly, and noting any outward leaks under the seal.

### Part V: Attachments
Next, decide how you want to attach the mask to your face.  You can tie elastic to the holes, like this:

<p align="center">
   <img src="https://github.com/tbensky/3dprinted-mask/blob/master/elastic_ties.jpg">
</p>

We found the masks hard to adjust this way, so we made a T-shaped add-on that allows one to use button-hole elastic. Here’s the adapter (design file [here](https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:4283952)):

<p align="center">
   <img src="https://github.com/tbensky/3dprinted-mask/blob/master/T320.jpeg">
</p>

It goes into the mask like this:

<p align="center">
   <img src="https://github.com/tbensky/3dprinted-mask/blob/master/button_hole.jpeg">
</p>

In case you don’t know what “button-hole” elastic is (we didn’t), it’s elastic with evenly spaced slits cut it in, like this:

<p align="center">
   <img src="https://github.com/tbensky/3dprinted-mask/blob/master/button_hole.JPG">
</p>

With the T-shaped adaptor and the button hole elastic, attachment and adjustment is very easy.  (You’ll need four adapters that fit into the mask’s existing holes (with a dab of super glue or hot glue from a glue gun) to hold them.  This will be an additional 3D print job, with a print of 4 of them taking 45 min. No supports are needed, and we used 10% infill..



### Part VI: Filter
This is the part with the most debate out there: what material to use as a filter. Whatever you use, you only need a piece a bit larger than the plastic filter holder, like this:

<p align="center">
   <img src="https://github.com/tbensky/3dprinted-mask/blob/master/filter_fit.JPG">
</p>

It’ll push firmly into the opening, from inside the mask like this:

#### Filter Materials

Here’s what we’ve learned about materials.

N95. Ideally, you’d like to use some N95 material, but this is in short supply. If you have a mask made of N95, you can cut up the mask and get many uses out of the material itself, instead of just one (one use per medical mask).

No N95? It turns out that HEPA vacuum cleaner bags work well for this, as outlined [here](https://smartairfilters.com/en/blog/best-materials-make-diy-face-mask-virus/) (see graphs) and [here](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24229526). You can start with common bags like this one, which claims to filter down to 2 micrometers.

<p align="center">
   <img src="https://github.com/tbensky/3dprinted-mask/blob/master/kenmore.JPG">
</p>

A virus however, is <1 micrometer, so we’ll have to do better. HEPA vacuum cleaner bags like these:

<p align="center">
   <img src="https://github.com/tbensky/3dprinted-mask/blob/master/meile_filters.JPG">
</p>

HEPA filters claim to filter to this level, and they’re [widely available](https://www.bedbathandbeyond.com/store/product/miele-airclean-fjm-dustbag/1016438286?keyword=meile-baggs).  It turns out that N95 masks and these HEPA vacuum cleaner bags seem to be made from similar materials as shown [here](https://youtu.be/ZWkLqJrjWe8).  

There is more debate out there, as some air filter bags can be made of fiberglass, the fibers of which you don’t want to breathe.  The Miele bags above appear to be made from polymer fibers (i.e. not glass), but you still don’t want to breathe them.  You can ease concerns in this way: 

* Add a layer of cotton material (T-shirt, bandana, etc.) or some of the 2 micron vacuum cleaner filter.. These are to be added on the “mouth side” of the filter assembly. Here’s a layer of the 2 micron material being peeled away from the bag:

<p align="center">
   <img src="https://github.com/tbensky/3dprinted-mask/blob/master/2micron.JPG">
</p>

* Be sure the fibrous side of the HEPA filter faces outward on your mask, and the smooth bag side faces inward, toward your mouth.

We do both. 

Here’s vacuum cleaner bag,

<p align="center">
   <img src="https://github.com/tbensky/3dprinted-mask/blob/master/vac_bag.JPG">
</p>

which we cut it up into as many squares as we could, sized just a bit larger than the filter holder as shown here:

<p align="center">
   <img src="https://github.com/tbensky/3dprinted-mask/blob/master/filter_fit.JPG">
</p>

Note the fibrous side is down/outward, and paperish “bag” material is inward.

### Part VII. All done

Be safe out there!
